        <h2>If You Hurt Nature, You Are Hurting Yourself</h2>
        <p>WHAT IS NATURE? There is a great deal of talk and endeavour to protect nature, the animals, the birds, the whales and dolphins,
             to clean the polluted rivers, lakes, fields and so on. Nature is not put together by thought, as religion and belief are.
              Nature is the tiger, that extraordinary animal with its energy, its great sense of power. Nature is the solitary tree in the field,
               the meadows and the grove; it is that squirrel shyly hiding behind a bough. Nature is the ant, the bee and all the living things of the earth.
                Nature is the river, not a particular river, whether the Ganga, the Thames or the Mississippi. Nature is those mountains, snow-clad,
                 with dark blue valleys and range of hills meeting the sea. The universe is part of nature. One must have a feeling for all this, not destroy it,
                  not kill for one’s pleasure or one’s table. We do kill cabbages, the vegetables we eat, but one must draw the line somewhere.
                   If you do not eat vegetables, how will you live? So one must intelligently discern.</p>

        <h2>Since we do not love nature, we do not know how to love human beings.
        </h2>
        <p>So we have lost our relationship with nature. If once we understood that relationship, its real significance then we would not divide property into yours and mine;
             though one might own a piece of land and build a house on it, it would not be ‘mine’ or ‘yours’ in the exclusive sense; it would be more a means of taking shelter.

            Because we do not love the earth and the things of the earth but merely utilise them, we are insensitive to the beauty of a waterfall and have lost the touch of life.
             We don’t sit with our backs against the trunk of a tree. And since we do not love nature, we do not know how to love human beings. We have lost the sense of tenderness, 
             that sensitivity, that response to things of beauty. It is only in the renewal of that sensitivity that we can have understanding of what is true relationship. That sensitivity
              does not come in the mere hanging of a few pictures, or in painting a tree, or putting flowers in your hair; sensitivity comes only when this utilitarian outlook is put aside. 
              It does not mean that you cannot use the earth; but you must use the earth as it is to be used. The earth is there to be loved, to be cared for, not to be divided as yours and mine.
               It is foolish to plant a tree and call it ‘mine’. Only when one is free of exclusiveness is there a possibility of having sensitivity, not only to nature but to human beings and to
                the ceaseless challenges of life.

        <h2>What Is the Meaning of Right Relationship With Nature?</h2>
        <p>QUESTION: What is the meaning of right relationship with nature?

            KRISHNAMURTI: I do not know if you have discovered your relationship with nature.
             There is no ‘right’ relationship, only the understanding of relationship. Right relationship implies the acceptance of a formula, as does right thought. Right thought and right thinking are two different things. 
             Right thought is merely conforming to what is respectable, whereas right thinking is movement, it is the product of understanding, and understanding is constantly undergoing modification and change.
